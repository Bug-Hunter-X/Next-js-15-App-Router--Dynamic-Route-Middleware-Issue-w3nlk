# Next.js 15 App Router: Dynamic Route Middleware Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when using middleware with dynamic routes.  The middleware doesn't behave as expected, potentially leading to incorrect rendering or routing.

## Bug Description:

The issue arises when defining middleware for a dynamic route. The middleware logic doesn't correctly handle the dynamic route segments, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Reproduction Steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the unexpected behavior.

## Expected Behavior:

The middleware should correctly intercept requests based on the dynamic route segment and modify the response or redirect accordingly.

## Actual Behavior:

The middleware behaves incorrectly, potentially resulting in incorrect rendering or routing.

## Solution:

The solution involves carefully handling the dynamic route parameters within the middleware function and ensuring correct usage of redirect or rewrite functions.
